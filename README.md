Musical Programming Environment for Renoise

If you are familiar with the series of drum machine/samplers from AKAI, in particular the MPC2000XL then you know how much fun it can be to make sampled music!

When I discovered Renoise I couldn't believe it! almost a substitute for my MPC! but, the interface is a little wide and has its own learning curve, nothing impossible just different. I wanted to control Renoise like I do my MPC. Quick access from one small set of buttons and the ability to create more or less bars quickly, erase a track or tap tempo to a track

I have combined a couple other tools (Show transport Stats & Tempo Tap) to create this, so a big thanks to the creators!

Almost all the functions in this tool can be controlled with your midi device. This creates the ability to allow you to midi map things in renoise that you normally would not be able to, or that would take multiple steps and the QWERTY keyboard to accomplish.

For example midi map the start selection marker in the "trim" screen to a midi slider or rotary controller and midi map the slice button and then you are be able to create slice markers on an audio sample without ever leaving the midi controller. Or midi map the plugin preset + or - to cycle through plugin presets without leaving your midi keyboard.

I have kept the code to under 5000 lines and all self contained in the main file. The tool performed better like this (latency) especially when triggering midi events 

* Note : Just a little info regarding what an MPC is "From Wikipedia" ..
Akai MPCs (originally MIDI Production Center, now Music Production Center) are a popular and well respected series of electronic musical instruments originally designed by Roger Linn and produced by the Japanese company Akai from 1988 onward.
